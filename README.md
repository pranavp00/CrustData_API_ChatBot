# Crust API ChatBot  

## Description  
**Crust API ChatBot** is a customer support chatbot designed to assist users by answering technical questions about Crustdata’s APIs. With an intuitive chat interface, the bot leverages advanced techniques to extract relevant information from the API documentation, ensuring accurate and helpful responses.  

## Features  
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Built with React for a seamless user experience.  
- **Relevant Answers**: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate responses from the API documentation.  
- **Efficient Search**: Implements FAISS as a vector database for fast and effective document retrieval.  
- **Streamlined Deployment**: Backend and frontend deployed using Render for scalability and accessibility.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: React  
- **Backend**: Flask  
- **Knowledge Base Management**: FAISS vector database  
- **Retrieval Technique**: RAG (using LangChain and Groq)  
- **Language Model**: Llama 3.1-8b-instant  

## Setup Instructions  
### Prerequisites  
1. Ensure the following are installed on your system:  
   - Python 3.8 or later  
   - Node.js (for React)  

2. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/username/Crust-API-ChatBot.git  
   cd Crust-API-ChatBot  
   ```  

### Backend Installation (Flask)  
1. Navigate to the backend directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd backend  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. Start the Flask server:  
   ```bash  
   python server.py  
   ```  

### Frontend Installation (React)  
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd ../frontend  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  

3. Start the React development server:  
   ```bash  
   npm start  
   ```  

## Usage  
1. Access the application via the URL https://crustdata-api-chatbot-1.onrender.com/ or `http://localhost:3000` during local development.  
2. Type a question about Crustdata’s APIs in the chat interface.  
3. Receive detailed, accurate responses in real time.  

### Example Questions  
- **What are the required parameters for the POST endpoint in Crustdata’s API?**  
- **What is the response format for the GET endpoint?**  
- **How do I authenticate requests without an API token?**  

## Deployment  
The Crust API ChatBot is deployed on Render for both backend and frontend.  

## Challenges Faced  

1. **Handling Ambiguity in User Queries**:  
   One of the key challenges was designing the chatbot to handle vague or ambiguous questions from users. To address this, we implemented a robust retrieval mechanism using RAG. The system was trained to discern the intent behind user queries and return relevant API documentation, even when the input was imprecise or unclear. Fine-tuning the chatbot’s response generation for better context understanding was essential for providing accurate answers.

2. **Integrating the Vector Database (FAISS)**:  
   Integrating FAISS for efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional embeddings from the Crustdata API documentation was another significant challenge. The goal was to ensure fast, low-latency responses to user queries while dealing with large volumes of documentation. Optimizing the indexing and search functions in FAISS was critical to ensuring that relevant information could be retrieved quickly and accurately, enabling a smooth user experience.
